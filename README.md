# Progreda Trial Offer: Unlimited Marketing Automation, 24/7 AI Assistant, Premium Support

Running a service business in 2026 means juggling client conversations across text, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, email, and appointment bookings while trying to remember who said what and when. Your phone keeps buzzing, your inbox is exploding, and somewhere in that chaos, potential customers are slipping through the cracks. If this sounds familiar, you're not alone—and there's actually a practical solution that doesn't involve hiring another assistant.

Progreda is what happens when someone finally builds marketing automation software for people who actually run businesses, not for people who love configuring software. It's an all-in-one platform that handles sales conversations, automates follow-ups, manages your CRM, builds websites and funnels, and runs on autopilot with AI assistance. Think of it as having a tireless virtual employee who never needs coffee breaks and doesn't ghost you on Monday mornings.

**What Makes Progreda Different from Your Current Setup**

Most business owners are running a frankenstein tech stack—one tool for email, another for SMS, a third for appointment scheduling, a fourth for website hosting, and a fifth for CRM. You're paying five subscriptions, logging into five dashboards, and manually copying information between systems like it's 1999. Progreda consolidates all of that into one platform.

The platform was created by AudateMedia, founded by Andy Audate, who understands what small business owners actually need. Not enterprise software that requires a computer science degree to operate, but something that works when you turn it on. The system serves coaches, consultants, tax professionals, beauty salons, law firms, real estate agents, and other service-based businesses who spend more time answering "When can you meet?" messages than they'd prefer.

What really sets Progreda apart is its conversational AI and automation engine. The AI Employee feature operates around the clock, handling customer inquiries, following up with leads automatically, booking appointments without your involvement, and even building basic websites and funnels. It's like having a marketing assistant, web designer, and sales rep combined into one digital tool that doesn't require health insurance.

The platform brings together CRM functionality, email marketing, SMS campaigns, funnel builders, landing pages, membership sites, appointment scheduling, and payment processing. Everything you need to capture leads and convert them into paying customers lives in one place. Progreda uses 40 edge servers worldwide for reliable hosting, includes built-in SEO tools, and handles unlimited hosting—meaning you can finally cancel that separate hosting account you've been paying for.

**The AI Employee That Actually Works**

Let's talk about the AI Employee Assistant, because this is where things get interesting. This isn't some chatbot that gives canned responses and frustrates your customers. Progreda's AI runs 24/7 to answer leads, automatically text back missed calls, book appointments directly into your calendar, build websites and funnels based on your specifications, and handle initial customer conversations across multiple channels simultaneously.

Here's how it works in practice. A potential customer finds your business at 11 PM on a Saturday night and sends a message on Facebook. Normally, that lead would sit there until Monday morning when you finally see it—by which time they've already contacted three of your competitors. With Progreda's AI Employee, they receive an immediate response, get answers to their basic questions, and can book an appointment right then and there. You wake up Monday morning to a confirmed appointment, not a missed opportunity.

The missed call text-back feature alone has changed how many businesses operate. Someone calls, you're busy with a client, the call goes to voicemail. In the old world, you'd try to call them back later when you had time, play phone tag for three days, and lose the sale. With Progreda, the system immediately sends them a text: "Hey, I saw you called. What can I help you with?" and starts a conversation automatically. Studies show that response times under five minutes increase close rates dramatically. Your customers move on when you wait. Progreda fixes this fundamental problem.

The AI doesn't just respond to incoming messages. It actively follows up with leads who haven't responded, sends appointment reminders to reduce no-shows, re-engages cold leads who went quiet six months ago, and moves customers through your sales pipeline automatically based on their actions and responses.

**Breaking Down the Plans and Real Costs**

Progreda offers three main tiers, and understanding the actual costs requires looking past the headline numbers. Here's the breakdown without the marketing fluff:

| Plan | Monthly Price | Monthly Credits Included | Effective Real Cost | Users & Contacts | Support Level | Best For |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Essential** | $197 | $10 credit | $187/month after credits | 2 users, 1,000 contacts | Standard support | Solopreneurs starting out |
| **Platinum** | $497 | $400 credit | $97/month after credits | Unlimited users & contacts | Premium Slack support + unlimited Zoom | Growing businesses needing full automation |
| **Diamond** | $749 | Varies | Contact for details | Unlimited | White-glove support | Established businesses scaling operations |

The monthly credit system matters more than it first appears. That $400 credit on the Platinum plan translates to approximately 6,700 text messages or 75,290 emails per month. For most small businesses, that's substantial. You're not paying $497 for the software—you're paying $97 for the platform and getting $400 worth of messaging credits you'd be paying for separately anyway.

**What Each Plan Actually Includes**

The Essential plan gives you the messaging inbox to talk with clients across all channels, full CRM with pipeline management, marketing tools to create websites and campaigns, automation workflows, calendar and appointment scheduling, payment processing with text-to-pay, invoice generation, forms and surveys, and pre-built funnel and automation templates. It's designed for solopreneurs who want everything in one place without overwhelming features they won't use.

If you're considering starting your journey with comprehensive automation and AI-powered support, the platform offers a compelling starting point for businesses ready to scale beyond manual operations.

👉 [Start your 7-day free trial with Progreda Platinum](https://progreda.com/399trial14?_by=li35)

The trial includes full access to all Platinum features, unlimited onboarding calls, premium customer support via Slack, and comprehensive training resources—giving you a genuine opportunity to test whether the platform fits your workflow before committing financially.

The Platinum plan includes everything from Essential, plus unlimited users and unlimited contacts (no more paying per seat or hitting contact limits), premium customer support via Slack with fast response times, unlimited Zoom support sessions for technical issues and strategy, technical quick-fix support for urgent problems, the AI Employee Assistant running 24/7, $400 monthly credit for SMS and email, unlimited marketing strategy consultation reviews, and the Progreda Facebook Ads Launcher. This tier is designed for growing businesses that want unlimited scalability with a full support team backing them up.

The Diamond plan adds social media scheduling across platforms, advanced reporting and analytics, blog management tools, survey builders, affiliate program management, proposal and estimate generators, and trigger links for advanced automation. This is for established businesses that need every available tool and white-glove support.

**Annual Plans Cut Costs Significantly**

If you're confident Progreda fits your needs after the trial, annual billing saves substantial money:

| Plan | Annual Price (Monthly Equivalent) | Annual Savings |
|------|-----------------------------------|----------------|
| Essential | $165/month (billed $1,980 annually) | Save $398/year |
| Platinum | $332/month (billed $3,984 annually) | Save $798/year |
| Diamond | $624/month (billed $7,488 annually) | Save $1,498/year |

The annual commitment makes sense for businesses that have tested the platform during the trial period and confirmed it replaces multiple existing tools. You're essentially getting two months free each year.

**The Trial Offer and How It Actually Works**

Progreda operates on a trial-first model rather than traditional discount codes. Instead of hunting for coupon codes with weird restrictions that might be expired, they offer extended trial periods that let you actually test the platform before committing. The standard offering is a seven-day free trial on the Platinum plan, with some promotional partnerships offering extended 14-day trials.

During your trial period, you get full access to the Progreda Platinum Plan (valued at $497/month), unlimited one-on-one onboarding calls (valued at $1,499), premium customer support via Slack, unlimited Zoom support sessions, technical quick-fix support (valued at $500/month), pre-built funnel and automation templates, and the Lead Generation Mastery Course (valued at $1,495). You're not getting a gimped trial version—you're getting the full platform with full support.

The trial requires a credit card for verification. They process a temporary $498 authorization that gets refunded within 24 hours. This is their way of ensuring you're serious and keeping your account running smoothly if you decide to continue. It's not a charge—it's a hold that disappears.

For businesses ready to consolidate their marketing stack into a single powerful platform, this trial period provides enough time to migrate basic operations, test the AI features thoroughly, and determine if the workflow matches your business processes.

👉 [Claim your extended trial with full Platinum access](https://progreda.com/399trial14?_by=li35)

The value proposition during the trial is straightforward: Use the platform with full features, leverage the unlimited support to get properly set up, and decide if it works for your business. If it does, continue at the regular rate. If not, cancel with a single email—no complicated cancellation process, no questions asked, no retention department trying to convince you to stay.

**Real User Experiences from the Trenches**

User feedback reveals both the strengths and practical challenges of Progreda. The platform has gained traction primarily through word-of-mouth in small business communities, particularly among service-based operations.

Users consistently praise Progreda for consolidating their tech stack. An accounting firm owner mentioned: "I've always been on the lookout for software that can streamline and optimize my sales process, and Progreda has surpassed my expectations. I couldn't be more satisfied with all the sales appointments I get. It's a game-changer." The platform helped them elevate service quality while boosting productivity.

A painting company owner highlighted the local marketing capabilities: "It's truly a blessing to have the ability to target the exact type of customer I want in a specific market, present them with tailored ads, and encourage them to purchase our services. Progreda, combined with Facebook Ads, has empowered my local service business to achieve this."

The AI Employee feature receives particular attention. Users appreciate having automated 24/7 responses to handle initial inquiries, missed call text-backs that don't require manual intervention, and appointment booking without their direct involvement. For businesses receiving inquiries outside standard business hours, this has proven valuable for capturing leads that would otherwise vanish.

**The Learning Curve Reality**

The platform is comprehensive, which creates both strength and challenge. New users typically need those onboarding calls included with the trial. This isn't an "install and forget" solution—you're building funnels, setting up automations, and configuring workflows. Think of it as getting a powerful toolkit that requires some assembly.

On freelance marketplaces, there's an active community of Progreda specialists offering setup and configuration services. This tells you something important: businesses value the platform enough to hire help getting it running properly. Complex tools that deliver substantial results often require proper setup. This isn't necessarily negative—it's realistic.

The Premium Slack support on the Platinum plan receives consistent positive mentions. Having a direct line to technical support with quick response times matters when you're trying to launch a campaign or troubleshoot an automation that isn't firing correctly. The unlimited Zoom support helps users get past setup hurdles faster than traditional email-based support tickets.

**Platform Reliability and Technical Performance**

Users report solid uptime and page loading speeds, thanks to those 40 global edge servers. The hosting is included and handles websites, funnels, and landing pages without requiring separate hosting accounts. For small businesses consolidating their infrastructure, this simplifies tech management and reduces monthly subscription fatigue.

The monthly credit system initially confuses some users, but once they understand it covers SMS and email costs rather than being an additional charge, the value proposition becomes clear. The $400 credit on Platinum effectively reduces the real cost significantly when you factor in what you'd pay separately for dedicated email marketing and SMS services.

**Where Progreda Excels and Where It Doesn't**

The platform serves specific industries particularly well. Service-based businesses with appointment scheduling needs, lead nurturing requirements, and heavy client communication get the most value. Coaches see clients book themselves automatically. Real estate agents manage property inquiries across multiple channels from one inbox. Beauty salons fill cancellations with automated text campaigns. Law firms nurture leads with automated follow-up sequences.

If you're running a pure e-commerce store focused primarily on product sales without the service component, other specialized platforms might fit better. Progreda is built for businesses where human interaction drives revenue, and automation handles the repetitive parts of that interaction.

Most satisfied users share a common pattern: they committed past the initial setup phase, utilized the onboarding support fully, and actually implemented the automations rather than letting them sit unused. The businesses that struggle typically expect a plug-and-play solution without investing time in configuration.

The month-to-month cancellation policy receives positive mentions. Knowing you can exit with one email if it's not working provides peace of mind during the trial and initial months. No long-term contracts, no cancellation fees, no retention department pressure.

**Facebook Ads Launcher and Marketing Integration**

The Facebook Ads Launcher feature on the Platinum plan deserves specific mention. It's valued at $700/month as a standalone service and lets you start Facebook and Instagram ads in just a few clicks using ready-to-use templates, without needing marketing agency expertise. You're not a Facebook Ads specialist, and you don't need to become one.

The launcher connects your ads directly to Progreda's automation engine. Someone clicks your ad, lands on your funnel, enters their information, and immediately enters your automated follow-up sequence. The AI Employee can start conversing with them instantly. This closed-loop system—from ad click to booked appointment—runs automatically once configured.

For local service businesses, this integration has proven particularly valuable. You can target specific geographic areas, present tailored offers, and automate the entire conversation from initial contact to scheduled service. One painting company owner noted this combination of targeted Facebook Ads and Progreda automation fundamentally changed how they acquire customers.

**Comparing Progreda to HighLevel and Alternatives**

The most common comparison is to GoHighLevel, the dominant player in this space. Progreda positions itself as a more accessible alternative with stronger support. HighLevel is tailored for enterprises with substantial budgets and extensive teams, with pricing that reflects that positioning. Progreda starts at $197 per month for Essential, making it accessible to solopreneurs and small businesses who can't justify enterprise-level expenses.

The key differentiator isn't features—both platforms offer similar capabilities. It's the support structure and pricing philosophy. Progreda emphasizes unlimited human support on the Platinum plan, with premium Slack access and unlimited Zoom sessions. You're not submitting tickets and waiting days. You're getting real-time help from people who know the platform.

If you're focused on white-label reselling and building a software business, HighLevel might fit better. If you're looking to build your own business and optimize your specific operations, Progreda provides the support and tools you need without the enterprise overhead. The company explicitly states: "If you are focused on selling software and managing client relationships, Highlevel is the perfect fit. However, if you are looking to build your business and optimize your unique offers, Progreda will provide the support and tools you need to thrive."

**Making the Decision: Is Progreda Right for Your Business?**

Progreda makes the most sense for service-based businesses currently juggling multiple tools and manual processes. If you're manually copying lead information between systems, responding to messages at 11 PM because you don't have automated responses, playing phone tag with potential clients for three days before connecting, managing appointments in a spreadsheet or paper calendar, sending follow-up emails manually, or paying for separate CRM, email, SMS, website hosting, and funnel builder subscriptions—Progreda consolidates all of that.

The platform doesn't make sense for businesses that don't communicate with customers digitally, purely e-commerce operations without service components, companies that need ultra-specialized industry-specific software, or businesses that prefer multiple best-in-class tools over consolidated platforms. You're trading specialized perfection for integrated convenience.

The trial period removes the risk from this decision. Seven days (or 14 with promotional links) gives you enough time to migrate basic contact information, set up one or two automation workflows, test the AI Employee with real leads, build a simple funnel or landing page, integrate your calendar and test appointment booking, and evaluate whether the platform fits your daily workflow.

For businesses that commit to actually using the platform rather than just signing up and forgetting about it, the combination of automation, AI assistance, and unlimited support creates genuine operational improvements.

👉 [Get started with Progreda's full-featured trial](https://progreda.com/399trial14?_by=li35)

With no long-term contract requirements and straightforward monthly cancellation, testing the platform presents minimal risk for businesses genuinely interested in consolidating their marketing automation infrastructure.

**What Happens After Your Trial**

If you love Progreda after the trial, you continue at your chosen plan rate—$197/month for Essential or $497/month for Platinum (effectively $97/month after the $400 monthly credit). If it's not the right fit, you send one email to cancel. They're month-to-month with no contracts, which means no cancellation hassles, no retention department calling you, and no questions about why you're leaving.

The 100% no-risk approach isn't just marketing talk. Businesses that test the platform during the trial either find it replaces multiple tools and stays, or decide it's not the right fit and leave. There's no middle ground of paying for software you don't use because you're stuck in a contract.

For businesses ready to move past the chaos of disconnected tools and manual follow-up processes, Progreda offers a consolidated solution worth testing. The combination of comprehensive features, AI-powered automation, and unlimited human support creates a platform designed for businesses that want to grow without proportionally growing their administrative overhead.

The trial period provides genuine evaluation time without financial commitment. Use it to determine if the platform matches your business needs, leverage the unlimited support to get properly configured, and make an informed decision based on actual usage rather than sales promises.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**Does Progreda require technical skills to set up?**
No advanced technical skills are required, though there is a learning curve. The platform uses drag-and-drop, no-code interfaces for most functions. During your trial, you get unlimited onboarding calls and Zoom support sessions to help with setup. Many users hire Progreda specialists for initial configuration, but this isn't mandatory.

**Can I migrate my existing contacts and workflows?**
Yes, Progreda supports contact imports from CSV files and most major CRM systems. The onboarding team can assist with migration of contacts, websites (up to 10 pages), and phone number transfers during your trial period.

**What happens to my data if I cancel?**
You can export your contacts and data before canceling. Progreda doesn't hold your information hostage. After cancellation, your data is retained for a period allowing you to retrieve it if needed.

**Does the AI Employee replace human interaction?**
No, it handles initial responses, qualification, and appointment booking. Complex questions and actual sales conversations still involve you. Think of it as a very capable receptionist, not a replacement for your expertise.

**Can I use my own domain name?**
Yes, you can connect custom domains to your Progreda websites and funnels. The platform includes hosting, so you don't need a separate hosting account.
